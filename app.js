Want some crisp-concise film reviews?.. Well well you have come to the right place . I'll be presenting before you my honest revies and feelings of the films that I watch below here in the blog , if you want me to do a review of a film of your interest you can mail me on the email given in the contact page. I hope you have a nice time as a reader , because I can assure you that I am having a nice time as a movie reviewer (watching movies is my job guysðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª)";
const aboutContent = "Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films and the film medium. In general, film criticism can be divided into two categories: journalistic criticism which appears regularly in newspapers, magazines and other popular mass-media outlets; and academic criticism by film scholars who are informed by film theory and are published in academic journals. Academic film criticism rarely takes the form of a review; instead it is more likely to analyse the film and its place within the history of its genre, or the whole of film history.  My revies somewhere lie between these two types , a bit professional a bit unprofessional , so that in a way I write logical things that can oscillate with my general viewers .";
